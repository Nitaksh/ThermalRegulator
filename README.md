# ThermalRegulator
An IOT switch that can be controlled from anywhere over the internet ,a humidity and temperature sensor was also used to poll the temperature of the Thermal Regulated component over the internet to the user. The component also gets automatically switched off if it reaches its thermal limits. This would be useful in crypt mining applications.
